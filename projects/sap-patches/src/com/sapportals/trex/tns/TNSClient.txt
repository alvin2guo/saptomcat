==Patch Provided by SISU===

Edit the following method 
{{{
  private synchronized Transferable sendRequest(Transferable request) throws TrexException
}}}

Ensure that the String used to store the master name server (in our version it is named `masterNS`, decompilation results may vary) is never `null`. 
The value is populated with the result from the `TrexConfigManager.getMasterNameServer()` call.

Something along the lines of the following is all that needs to be added:
{{{
  if (masterNS == null) {
    masterNS = "";
  }
}}}
