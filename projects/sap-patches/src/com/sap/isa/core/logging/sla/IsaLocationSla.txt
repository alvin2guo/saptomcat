==Patch Provided by SISU===

This is a logging class, we want to make it log to log4j so that everything ends up in a single easily managed location.

Lots of changes here, so these notes are started and are by no means complete:
 * Drop the existing fields:
   {{{
     private Location location
     private static Map mSessions
     private statid Map mLocations
   }}}
 * Add a new field to hold a log4j logger
   {{{
     private org.apache.log4j.Logger location
   }}}
 * Modify the constructor to initialise the logger
   {{{
     location = Logger.getLogger(name);
   }}}
 * Fix all the errors that now exist, it should be a fairly straightforward translation to the log4j logger
 * It's probably worth fixing the implementation of the following method so that you get full information even if there are no available message resources
   {{{
     private String getResourceBundleString(Object key, Object args[])
   }}}
