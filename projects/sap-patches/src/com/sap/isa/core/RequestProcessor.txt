Edit the method:
{{{
  public void process(HttpServletRequest  request, HttpServletResponse response)
}}}

In the `catch (Throwable)` block comment out the entire `if`-`else` block, '''except''' the `log.error` call

This just means that errors will always get logged to the log file, rather than to standard error.
